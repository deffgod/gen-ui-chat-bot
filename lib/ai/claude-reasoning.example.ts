/**
 * Claude Reasoning Example
 * 
 * This file provides an example of how to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet with reasoning capabilities.
 * NOTE: This is an EXAMPLE file only, not meant to be imported directly into your application.
 * 
 * To use this approach:
 * 1. Make sure your AI SDK packages are compatible
 * 2. Copy the relevant code into your component or API route
 * 3. Adjust as needed for your specific use case

/**
 * Alternative approach: If you want to integrate Claude with reasoning into your existing setup,

 * 
 * The current recommendation is to use generateText directly in components or API routes
 * that need the reasoning capability, rather than trying to integrate it into the
 * customProvider setup in models.ts
